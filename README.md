# Haptic-Footwear
The "Haptic Footwear" project was conducted by the Electronics Club, under the Science and Technology Council of IIT Kanpur. The essential aim of the project is to build smart shoes through which you will be able to save your valuable time through hassle-free navigation, track and analyze your activity levels and stop tripping over objects. These shoes would help the disabled navigate and abled emancipate themselves from bulky and inaccurate electronic devices.

Smartphone GPS facilities are used to provide turn-by-turn routing information through Bluetooth to the microcontroller in the shoe, which is communicated via Vibration Actuators.

The shoe has pressure sensors and an accelerometer which will provide us with data.

A smartphone performs real-time fall risk estimation through signal processing, pattern recognition, and classification.

The main learning outcomes from this project were:

--> Understanding Arduino and other microcontrollers. Created basic circuits using Displays and Bulbs.

--> Used a WiFi controlled Node MCU for glowing a LED bulb.

--> Used MIT App Inventor to make a mobile App which Uses Bluetooth to communicate with Arduino.

--> Used HC05 Bluetooth Module and MIT App Inventor to toggle an LED and count steps via a force sensor.

--> Used Ultrasonic and IR Sensors for Obstacle detection, which would help in fall prevention.

--> Learned about various Graph Algorithms to find shortest paths, which would be used for navigation purposes.

--> Read various research papers on performing fall prevention via LIDAR/ Stereo Cameras and performing obstacle detection algorithms with the data recieved.
